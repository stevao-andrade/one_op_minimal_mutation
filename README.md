# one_op_minimal_mutation

This experiment investigates the effectiveness of adequated test case to a given mutation operators when applied to the minimum set of mutants. We evaluated a set of 39 programs written in C in which appropriate test cases were designed for all mutation operators and the effectiveness of them has measured in terms of the number of minimal mutants that the test set was capable of kill.
